//Definition of a closure

// Scope of a function at the time it was defined is retained. 
// Not the scope when the function was invoked.

// A function defined inside an outer function can be invoked using the scope it was defined although
// the outer function has already completed execution.


// Difference between var and no-var
/*

 var or no-var in global scope - NO DIFFERENCE.
 var inside a scope is for that scope only. 
 
 if no-var then it searches the scope chain to resolve. If not found, creates one with global scope
 
 ECMA5
 In strict mode, assignment to an undeclared identifier is a ReferenceError.

var foo = { // window is implied here, window.foo
   fooMethod: function() {
       alert('foo' + 'bar'); // window is implied here, window.alert
       window.alert('foo' + 'bar'); /* window is explicitly used, 
                                    with the same effect */
   }
}

/*
Being explicit [e.g., window.alert() versus alert()] costs a little bit more with regards to 
performance (how fast the code runs). Itâ€™s faster if you rely on the scope chain alone and 
avoid explicitly referencing the head object even if you know the property you want is 
contained in the global scope.
*/

//THIS keyword
//When a function is created, a keyword called this is created (behind the scenes), 
//which links to the object in which the function operates. Said another way, 
//this is available to the scope of its function, yet is a reference to the object of 
//which that function is a property/method.
var cody = {
   living : true,
   age : 23,
   gender : 'male',
   getGender : function() {return cody.gender;} //or this.gender
};

/*
As opposed to arguments and any parameters sent to the function, 
this is a keyword (not a property) in the call/activation object.
*/

//The value of this, passed to all functions, is based on the context in which the function 
//is called at runtime

var foo = 'foo';
var myObject = {foo: 'I am myObject.foo'};

var sayFoo = function() {
   console.log(this['foo']);
};

// give myObject a sayFoo property and have it point to sayFoo function
myObject.sayFoo = sayFoo;

myObject.sayFoo(); // logs 'I am myObject.foo'
sayFoo(); // logs 'foo'


//All variables except this and arguments follow lexical scope.

//this when it is used inside of a function that is contained inside of another function. 
//The bad news is in ES3, this loses its way and refers to the head object 
//(window object in browsers), instead of the object within which the function is defined.

var myObject = {
   func1: function() {
       console.log(this); // logs myObject
       var func2 = function() {
          console.log(this) // logs window, and will do so from this point on
          var func3 = function() {
              console.log(this); // logs window, as it's the head object
          }();
       }();
   }
}
myObject.func1();

//A WA is to store the 'this' into 'that' and refer 'that' from then on.
//Another scenario
//fixed in ES5
var foo = {
   func1:function(bar) {
       bar(); // logs window, not foo
       console.log(this); /* the this keyword here will be a reference to 
                          foo object */
